### Here is what I'm working onðŸ‘‹


I am currently working as a researcher in digital humanities and artificial intelligence at the World Asbar Forum, 
and because of my passion for data science and artificial intelligence, I have worked on several projects in several languages, 
including Sakila Movie database project using SQL language, US Bikeshare data project using Python language and Version Control for one of the international companies, 
Corona virus data analysis project using R language and shiny app.

I am looking to collaborate and contribute on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with other teams.
